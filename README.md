# Pain in the Task! A project by Phil Garrigan (Front-end README)

Let's be honest, nobody actually enjoys doing 90% of the things that go onto a task list. However, that's no reason to be unorganized! Pain in the Task aims to help keep users organized by tracking tasks and to-do's in an effective and visually appealing manner. Tasks can be created, modified, renamed, or deleted and saved instantly. application.

I tried to follow the steps below, as best as possible, while creating my application.

+ Start by setting up the initial requirements of the API, inlcuding heroku, rails, database tables.
+ Finalize and test API functionality.

#### User stories
+ As a user, I would like to sign in.
+ As a user, I would like to be able to change my password.
+ As a user, I would like to be able to sign out.
+ As a user, I would like to access my tasks.
+ As a user, I would like to create new tasks.
+ As a user, I would like to delete tasks.
+ As a user, I would like to edit tasks.
+ As a user, I would like to mark tasks as complete, but still have access to them (stretch).
+ As a user, I would like to organize my tasks into lists. (stretch).

## Unsolved Problems / Future Plan

+ I would like to add another resource to my API. This resource would be Lists, in which the user would be able to organize their tasks into specific lists.
+ I would like to add a feature where the user can mark tasks as complete. This would take the tasks off of the visible listing of open tasks, but would store them elsewhere, in case the user would like to access them in the future.
